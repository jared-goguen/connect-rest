# connect-rest

An in-progress project for a website where users can play Connect Four with each other. 

The frontend is in React (with react-router and redux). The backend uses the Django REST framework and only provides an API for AJAX requests from the frontend.

The entry-point of the frontend is [/app/containers/App.jsx](/app/containers/App.jsx). All of the style-based React components are in (app/components)[app/components] and all of the logic-based Reacat components are in (app/containers)[app/containers].
